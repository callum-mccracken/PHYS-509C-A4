\section{Chi-squared fits with systematics.}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\Alph*}.]
    \item A theory predicts that a variable $y$ depends on a variable $x$ according to: $y = 3x^2 -1$. A dataset is obtained. The resolution on each y measurement is 0.02. Use a $\chi^2$ statistic to test whether the data are consistent with the theory. Quote a p-value.

    The dataset: x y

    0.1 -0.951
    
    0.2 -0.842
    
    0.3 -0.741
    
    0.4 -0.492
    
    0.5 -0.229
    
    0.6 0.118
    
    0.7 0.494
    
    0.8 0.957
    
    0.9 1.449
    
    1.0 2.055

    \item Your graduate student now comes to you with worries about a possible systematic on the measured $y$ values. She suspects that each $y$ value could be shifted by an amount $dy=ax$, where $a$ is some constant. Through diligent work she has determined that $a=0\pm0.05$. Repeat the calculation of Part A, this time including the effects of this systematic uncertainty.
