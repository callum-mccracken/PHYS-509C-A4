\section{Consider flipping an unfair coin ten times, and getting 10 heads. Calculate the Feldman-Cousins 90\% confidence interval for \texorpdfstring{$p$}{p}, the probability of getting heads on the coin. Submit a copy of your code or equivalent.}

Since we're told this is an unfair coin but nothing else, it seems fair to say $P(p)=1, p \in [0,1]$.

Find our maximum likelihood $p_{\text{best}}$, using $d$ to refer to the data of getting $k$ heads in 10 tries:

\begin{align*}
    L(k|p, N) &= \frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} p^{n}(1-p)^{N-n} \\
    L(d|p) &= \frac{10!}{k!(10-k)!} p^{k}(1-p)^{10-k} \\
\end{align*}

For any value of $k$ we can maximize this, and from a previous question we found the $p_{\text{best}} = \frac{k}{N}$.

Now calculate the likelihood ratio:

\begin{align*}
    R &= \frac{L(d|p)}{L(d|p_{\text{best}})} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{10!}{k!(10-k)!} p^{k}(1-p)^{10-k}}{\frac{10!}{k!(10-k)!} \frac{k^k}{N^k}\left(1-\frac{k}{N}\right)^{10-k}} \\
\end{align*}

Numerically, for a given $p$ we start from the highest $R$ and go to lower $R$ until the integral of $L$ is 0.9. See the code for my implementation, but I find the Feldman-Cousins confidence interval is $[0.79, 1]$.
